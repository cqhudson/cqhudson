### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Connor Hudson

Here are some things I've made:

- **Win32ContentPrepToolGUI** -> Wrapper for the Microsoft Content Prep Tool for Intune written in VB.NET, using WinForms and .NET Core 6

- **Firefox Brave Search Engine Add-on** -> A Firefox add-on that allows users to add the Brave Search Engine as a default search provider, and removes the prompt asking users to download Brave Browser. [Download it here!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brave-search-engine/)

- **Telegram Meme Bot - Proof of Concept** -> A Telegram bot written in Java on JDK 22 that uses REST APIs to grab memes from Reddit and send them to users in Telegram.
