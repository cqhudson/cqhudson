### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Connor Hudson

I'm a CS student, here are some things I've made or am working on:

- **Win32ContentPrepToolGUI** -> Wrapper for the Microsoft Content Prep Tool for Intune written in VB.NET, using WinForms and .NET Core 6

- **Telegram Meme Bot - Proof of Concept** -> A Telegram bot written in Java on JDK 22 that uses REST APIs to grab memes from Reddit and send them to users in Telegram.
